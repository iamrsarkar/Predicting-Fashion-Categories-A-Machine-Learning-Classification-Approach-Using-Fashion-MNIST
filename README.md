Fashion MNIST Classification
A machine learning project for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using SVM, Softmax, Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, Adaboost, Random Forest, Voting classifier. This project demonstrates preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

Project Overview
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels in 10 categories such as T-shirts, shoes, and bags. The goal is to classify these images into their respective categories using a machine learning model.
